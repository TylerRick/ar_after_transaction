Do something only after the currently open transactions have finished.

Normally everything gets rolled back when a transaction fails, but you cannot roll back sending an email or adding a job to Resque.

Install
=======

Add this line to your Gemfile:

    gem 'ar_after_transaction'

and run `bundle install`.

Usage
=====

### Define `after_transaction` callbacks anywhere within a transaction

Inside of a model...

    class User
      after_create :deliver_created_notification, :create_log_entry, :something_else

      def deliver_created_notification
        after_transaction do
          UserMailer.created(self).deliver  # Cannot be rolled back
        end
      end

      def create_log_entry
        entry = log_entries.create!(logged_changes: changes)  # This will be rolled back
      end

      def something_else
        raise ActiveRecord::Rollback
      end
    end

    User.create!  # Won't deliver any e-mails because the transaction was rolled back

In this case, using the
[`after_commit`](http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Transactions/ClassMethods.html#method-i-after_commit)
callbacks provided by Active Record would have been an easier solution:

    class User
      after_commit :deliver_created_notification, :on => :create
      after_commit :deliver_deleted_notification, :on => :destroy

      def deliver_created_notification
        UserMailer.created(self).deliver
      end
      def deliver_deleted_notification
        UserMailer.deleted(self).deliver
      end
    end

But there are some cases where an `after_commit` callback on a model won't work. This gem lets you
define an inline `after_commit` callback for a transaction *anywhere*, even outside of a model. For
example:

    ActiveRecord::Base.transaction do
      @import_file.each_row do |row|
        thing = Thing.create!(row)

        ActiveRecord::Base.after_transaction do
          send_notifications_for(thing)
          thing.rebuild_thumbnails
        end

        if error_condition || user_wants_to_abort?
          raise ActiveRecord::Rollback
        end
      end
    end

### Add `after_commit` callbacks around anything that should not happen if a transaction is rolled
back

    Resque.class_eval do
      def self.enqueue_on_commit(*args)
        ActiveRecord::Base.after_commit do
          enqueue(*args)
        end
      end
    end

    Mail::Message.class_eval do
      def deliver_on_commit
        ActiveRecord::Base.after_transaction { deliver }
      end
    end

### When not in a transaction
after_transaction will perform the given block immediately

### Transactional fixtures <-> normally_open_transactions
after_transaction assumes zero open transactions.<br/>
If you use transactional fixtures you should change it in test mode.

    # config/environments/test.rb
    config.after_initialize do
      ActiveRecord::Base.normally_open_transactions = 1
    end

Alternative
===========
[after_commit](https://github.com/pat/after_commit)<br/>
 + threadsafe<br/>
 + more fine-grained callbacks (before_commit, `after_commit`, before_rollback, after_rollback)<br/>
 - doesn't let you define `after_transaction` callbacks *anywhere* like `ar_after_transaction` does (*outside* of the `after_commit`, etc. callbacks which only happen at certain points in the model's life cycle)<br/>
 - more complex<br/>
